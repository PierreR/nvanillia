" D. Crockford is in favor of 4 spaces and no tabs; jquery src uses tabs
" I personnaly prefer tab to mark indentation and spaces for everything else (see smarttab):
" - I don't believe everyone should view indent as 4 spaces always; javascript is too cosmopolite for this.
" - Sometimes Js mixes with HTML and there you might not like 4 spaces either
setlocal noexpandtab
setlocal tabstop=2
